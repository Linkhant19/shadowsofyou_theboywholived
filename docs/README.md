# shadowsofyou_theboywholived

This repo is a part of my collection called "Shadows of You". 
I wanted to present some of the poems that I wrote in a new and interesting way, so I created a flip book website for each poem. 
This one is named: The Boy Who Lived

<h2><em>
What is Shadows of You? 
</em></h2>
<em>
On an ordinary day, on an ordinary night, you are walking through the same-old streets or lying in
your same old bed. Suddenly, you hear a piercing scream and they have appeared again. Shadows. You see them on
the strangers in the street. The white walls that you used to scribble your dreams on are now covered in horrid
silhouettes. Peter lost his shadow to fly away, but now you are falling again.

You wonder. If they left, then why do you still see shadows of them at 1 am on the walls in your
dimly lit bedroom? You see shadows under the spotlights of your past, your present, and your future, and you
begin to fear if this is a selfish decision to let these people who care about you into your life. All you are is
heavy-weight carrying every shadow of your past, and even though you try so hard to be as light as bright sunshine
for those you love, sooner or later, they will get introduced to the tears that come out at 2 am. Before you can
change, they have also become part of the shadows on the white walls. They have walked out of your door.
