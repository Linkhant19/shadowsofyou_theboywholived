                            How were you to know the boy you saved would turn out to be  <br>such a disappointment?  <br>
                            How were you to know he is not going to give you a biological child  <br>like you always wanted? <br>
                            How were you to know this ungratefulness of a child fantasized so much  <br>about taking his life you spent your blood, sweat, and tears to save?  <br>
                            <br>
                            You shouldn’t have spent most of your savings  <br>on his hospital bills <br>
                            You shouldn’t have wasted your time trying to push him  <br>toward a life you sacrificed <br>
                            Because your dreams of dreaming your dreams through his is going  <br>to be. just… dreams.  <br>
                            <br>
                            If only you pulled the plug back then,  <br>
                            There would have been less suffering for all four of us.  <br>
                            Now I am just sitting in this room and…

                            Sometimes I feel like I’ve lost the pulse <br>
                            And, I am just waiting for my body <br>
                            To fall to the ground and leave all of you<br>
